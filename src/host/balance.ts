/**
 * The DeepSeek open-platform BALANCE route — the data behind the Context
 * Dashboard's header capsule (client/balance.ts).
 *
 * The platform exposes exactly one account endpoint (`GET /user/balance`);
 * reaching it needs the API key, which by design never rides to the browser,
 * so the HOST reads it and serves the redacted figures. The connection facts
 * resolve per request, exactly as the DeepSeek provider serves its own
 * requests: its settings row carries the credential ref and the optional
 * endpoint override, read through whichever face the running line serves
 * (deepseekSectionOf), and the credentials service resolves the ref to the
 * key. Any missing fact — the provider absent, no settings service, no key —
 * answers a typed `null`, as does a failed or malformed platform read: the
 * capsule renders nothing rather than a stale figure.
 *
 * The transport is Connection's fetch-route registry (the same authenticated
 * `/api` fence host/detail.ts mounts), registered through a deferred inject
 * so load order never matters and a harness without the registry simply
 * never arms the route. Identical reads share one outbound fetch while it is
 * in flight, and nothing outlives it: the platform's balance moves with every
 * billed request, so a remembered figure would disagree with the console page
 * the capsule links to.
