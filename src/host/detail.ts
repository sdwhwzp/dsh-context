/**
 * The on-demand DETAIL route of the split `contextTimeline` generation.
 *
 * The projection's wire value is the slim head (fold.ts `buildTimelineHead`);
 * the heavy collections (per-request records, context events, the served
 * surface window, the removed-node archive) are served HERE instead — one
 * targeted read per viewing client, only while its Context tab or /context
 * modal is open, instead of riding every session.list row, control baseline,
 * follow snapshot, and push frame whole (see shared/types.ts
 * `ContextTimelineDetail`).
 *
 * The transport is Connection's exact Fetch-route registry
 * (`ctx.connection.fetch.register`) — the same seam the harness's own file
 * upload and media-reference routes mount through, riding the authenticated
 * `/api` fence. The handler resolves the session through the harness's own
 * ladder: a LIVE session's unit state comes straight off the registry's
 * `stateOf` (no second fold); a session only ever VIEWED cold (prepared into
 * the observation cache — `SessionStore.prepare` never enters it into the
 * live store) is observed through `ctx.sessionQuery` and its immutable log
 * folded from init (cheap: a cold session's log is static, and the client's
 * per-session store reads it once per page view). A session that left the
 * live set mid-request, a unit that never registered, or a session nothing
 * can observe resolves to a typed `null` — the client keeps its last detail
 * and offers a retry, never an unhandled rejection.
 *
 * Load order is never assumed: `watchDetailChannel` nests a `ctx.inject` on
 * the two faces the registration reads (connection, sessions), so a service
 * that activates AFTER this plugin still arms the route (cordis replays the
 * inject when the dependency set completes). The returned gate is read by
 * the timeline unit's view at every serve, so the wire generation flips to
 * slim the moment the route goes live and flips back if it unloads — the
 * client reconciles both (it detects the generation per value,
 * timelineSource.ts). A deployment whose connection/sessions services never
 * compose — or whose connection carries no fetch registry — keeps the gate
 * closed forever and serves the inline value unchanged.
