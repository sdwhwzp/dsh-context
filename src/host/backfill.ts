/**
 * The projection warm-up: a one-pass background backfill that gives every
 * stored session its `contextActivity` + `contextTimeline` rows — run on
 * demand, the first time its only reader opens.
 *
 * The overview's heatmap, KPI band, and session cards read the session
 * list's projection column, which serves durable cache rows only (zero-I/O).
 * A session folded before a projection unit existed — `contextActivity` on
 * upgrade, `contextTimeline` for a session that predates the plugin — or
 * whose rows went version-stale (a `stateVersion` bump, e.g. the timeline's
 * `lastUser` preview) has no usable row until it next goes live, so the
 * heatmap would stay empty, the KPI band would undercount, and the cards
 * would show their no-data note and no preview indefinitely. The cache's
 * cold-read ladder (`sessionProjectionCache.coldSnapshot`) closes exactly
 * that gap: read the stored log once, seed each unit from its cached rows,
 * fold the remainder, and write the refreshed checkpoint back (the cache
 * does the write-back itself).
 *
 * The pass runs when summoned, not at boot. The dashboard is the rows' only
 * reader, so an at-startup warm-up would make every deployment cold-read its
 * whole corpus on every boot whether the dashboard is ever opened or not —
 * and a legacy log the running harness refuses to migrate (a v0 artifact
 * carrying events outside the released migration surface) would re-attempt
 * and re-report on every boot, for nothing. Instead the client POSTs
 * `/api/dsh-context/backfill` when the dashboard first opens
 * (overviewPanel.tsx); the host answers at once and runs the pass once per
 * process — later opens (and later POSTs) are no-ops, and the pass arms
 * regardless of which of the two halves composes first.
 *
 * OPTIONAL BY CONTRACT: the connection / sessionQuery / sessionProjectionCache
 * / sessionPersistence / sessions services compose on every standard
 * deployment, but a deployment may strip any of them — both halves ride
 * deferred injects, every face is re-proved structurally before use, and
 * each session's read is isolated (one unreadable log costs just itself,
 * logged). A deployment whose client cannot mount the trigger route (no
 * connection service, no exact-route registry) simply never runs the pass —
 * the same deployments could not open the dashboard to read the rows anyway.
 * Live sessions are skipped: they fold every unit themselves and checkpoint
 * on the mandatory points, so a cold write would only race them. Skips are
 * accounted, not spammed: a log the harness refuses to migrate is permanent
 * and source-side — its per-session detail drops to debug and the pass ends
 * with one summary info line; only unexpected per-session failures keep
 * their own warn.
